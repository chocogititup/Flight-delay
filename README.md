Here's a sample **GitHub README** for your **Flight Delay Prediction Model** project. It's structured to be clear, professional, and easy for users and recruiters to follow:

---

# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction Model

Predict flight delays using machine learning models trained on historical flight data. This project helps airlines and passengers anticipate delays and plan accordingly.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Flight delays cause major inconveniences for passengers and significant financial losses for airlines. This project uses machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can forecast whether a flight will be delayed based on historical flight data and relevant features such as departure time, weather, and airline carrier.
